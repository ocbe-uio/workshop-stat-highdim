title: "Statistical Principles in Machine Learning for Small Biomedical Data"
---

Date: **Tuesday 10 December 2024, 13:00-16:00**

Room: **Prolog (room 2465), Ole-Johan Dahls hus (OJD)**

Instructors: Manuela Zucknick (main), Theophilus Asenso

# Welcome!

-   The goal of the workshop is to introduce key connected concepts in machine learning, such as generalisation, overfitting, bias-variance trade-off and regularisation.
-   The workshop is intended for students and researchers who are interested in applying machine learning methods to **small data** (few samples, but potentially many features) or **noisy data** (e.g. biomedical data)
-   Workshop material can be found in the workshop [github repository](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/workshop-stat-highdim).

#### Learning Objectives

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to

-   understand key concepts for training machine learning models on small or noisy data, such as generalisation, overfitting, bias-variance trade-off and regularisation;
-   understand how to incorporate data structure in the regularisation process.

#### Pre-requisites

-   Basic familiarity with R
-   Introductory level statistics, including regression
