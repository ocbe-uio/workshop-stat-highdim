title: "Statistical Principles in Machine Learning for Small Biomedical Data"
---

Date: **Monday 11 December 2023, 9:00-12:00**

Room: **Perl (room 2453), Ole-Johan Dahls hus (OJD)**

Instructors: Manuela Zucknick (main), Theophilus Asenso

# Welcome!

-   The goal of the workshop is to introduce kep concepts in machine learning, such as regularisation.
-   The workshop is intended for students and researchers who are interested in applying machine learning methods to **small data** (few samples, but potentially many features) or **noisy data** (e.g. biomedical data)
-   Workshop material can be found in the workshop [github repository](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/workshop-stat-highdim).

#### Learning Objectives

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to

-   understand key concepts for training machine learning models such as regularisation;
-   understand how to incorporate data structure in the regularisation process.

#### Pre-requisites

-   Basic familiarity with R
-   Introductory level statistics, including regression
